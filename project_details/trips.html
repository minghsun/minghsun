                    <p>This was a concept app design for a tour service. Althought in the end we couldn’t build the product for some reasons, I still had a great time designing the initial concept. The content provider wanted to build a in-depth tour service. There are independent bookstores in the places they’re targeting. And they had a bunch of great interviews with the bookstore owners. Each of them has great stories to tell. The bookstore owners will be the tour guild for this in-depth trip. And My mission was to design the app for this tour service. </p>

										<p>The biggest difference of this service from others is that they have really great stories of all the places. Joining this tour is just like reading the places. I wanted to emphasis on this critical point. After tons of discussion, I decided to go for a immersive design to lead the users into the stories. Aside from full-screen images and the texts, I attempted to design the interaction for a distraction-free experience.</p>
