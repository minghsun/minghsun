<p class="project-notes">Design lead, conducted user research and synthesis for insights, 2019</p>

<p>Smart collection is a solution with aggregated styled products and triggers for motivating unintentional purchases.</p>



<h3>Project background and problems</h3>
<p>Most users visit e-commerce websites with an intention. And users always compare prices of different sites. Therefore, many e-commerce websites try to attract users with lower price. As there are more and more competitors cutting down the prices, the situation got tougher and tougher for <a href="https://tw.buy.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo Shopping</a>. Having promotions to attract users is effective. However, it is a short-term solution and may hurt the platform in the long run. Since the problem is that most of the users are intentional and price-sensitive, our main goal was to motivate these users to make  unintentional purchases even when users visit Yahoo Shopping with intentions.</p>



<h3>Defining users and journey</h3>
<p>We did user research before this project and defined 4 types of users for Yahoo shopping. Our first step was to make sure what kind of users we‚Äôre designing for. So we started from examining the main journey of different types of users to see how we can drive the unintentional purchases. We mapped out the entire user journey of these 4 types of users. The journey includes the very beginning of the journey: just having an idea of buying something, the behaviour outside of Yahoo Shopping(for example google search or offline experiences), the browsing and buying experience within Yahoo Shopping and the return behaviour after purchases.</p>

<p>After discussion, we found that there are two types of users who have many explorations during their shopping journey. And in the exploration phase, there are high chances to drive unintentional purchase. Thus, we decided to focus on these two types of users: product focus and inspirational shopper</p>

They spend much time on exploring and understanding the product. When they decide what to buy, they usually compare the prices from different platforms.</span>

<h3>Define Scenario</h3>
<p>We looked into the potential scenarios of unintentional purchases. And we found the scenarios change when it comes to different categories of product. Therefore, we started to dig into main categories of our platform and found the following categories are more effective to drive the unintentional purchase: fashion, beauty & personal care, health & household, home & kitchen. From these categories, we found the common relevance is the visual look of products.</p>
<p>Our assumption is: most users have their preference in styles. When the users have intentions of buying something, they focus on what they are looking for with their preference. If the user sees their preferred products with other related products in the same style, there is a high chance to make the users start exploring more and lead to unintentional purchases eventually. Therefore, we identified styles as the main starting point of unintentional purchase<img src="images/p/smartcollection_02@2x.png" alt="Defining for scenarios" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0"><span class="caption" style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0;">Defining for scenarios</span></p>
<p>Also, we learned that many unintentional purchase scenarios happen when users are not buying something. Users may be just window shopping in a mall, reading magazines, or even just browsing on social media. All these scenarios happen because users inadvertently receive information related to user‚Äôs preferences and needs. So we then brainstormed on what values we can provide based on all these online and offline experiences to come up with design solutions.

<h3>The Design Solution</h3>

<p>Our design solution is divided into two parts. The first part is to motivate the intentional shoppers with inspirations. We know what products users are looking for in the explore / understand /compare stage. We can provide potential related products to motivate the users to browse more or even buy more. The second part of the solution is to diverse the intentions of the after-purchased users to close the shopping journey loop. We have strong signals after user browsing products and making purchases. Based on the signal, we are able to recommend highly related products to stimulate the users to start a new shopping journey.</p>

<p class="caption">Journey loop of the solution</p>

<p>When users visit Yahoo Shopping with an intention, they come and search for a product. They will see the entries of Smart Collection in the search result page. The entries show that Yahoo Shopping selected styled products recommended to users. Inside Smart Collection, there's a collection page with products in the same style. And the products are related to the search keyword. In addition to styled products, there are various inspirational modules with related products to motivate users to explore products that are not what the users intended to buy.</p>
<p>In the below scenario, the user intended to buy a backpack so he/she entered search result page with the keyword ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù. And we recommend the simple-styled backpack collection from the user‚Äôs previous browsing and buying preferences. With targeting preference, the user will visit Smart Collection to browse the simple-styled backpacks. And among the backpacks the user likes, there are also other recommendations to make the user browse not only backpacks but also different categories of products. The entire experience is like shopping in a fashion magazine. And we believe the magazine-like design can drive unintentional purchases.</p>

<p>Many users come back to Yahoo Shopping to check the order and shipping status after purchases. So after the user finished this journey of buying a backpack, we also provide another Smart Collection entry in the home tab of Yahoo Shopping when the users make the next visit. In the after-purchase Smart Collection we start to more proactively introduce products related to the purchased products in various categories and with the same style. Because when we have more information of the users, we‚Äôre able to diverse users‚Äô shopping experience with more accurate recommendations. In the example, we provide more fashion products when the user purchased the backpack. And in the stream, the user can imagine how all other products fit with the purchased backpack. We believe the solution can turn the intention-only product focus shoppers start to browse like the inspirational shoppers to make more unintentional purchases.</p>

<h3>User research to validate our design </h3>
<p>To validate our hypothesis before development, we conducted user research to understand how users get motivated when they‚Äôre shopping online and to verify if our assumptions were right. We used the diary study to learn the details of the scenario and user‚Äôs behaviour when they are browsing unintentionally in Yahoo Shopping and other e-commerce platform. Then we tested our design solution with high fidelity prototype to see if Smart Collection can motivate users to explore more on unintentional purchases.</p>
<p>The result was great. The Participants got motivated by the inspirational modules and explore more products without notice. They even showed appreciations on the inspirations we provided because these were something they hadn't thought of. We also learn more about how users‚Äô interest and thoughts on each of the inspiration modules.
</p>
<p>During the research, we also found some usability issues. We tried to introduce too many styles to users at once, so the user all ignore the Smart Collection entry. We iterated the design and tested the iterated version in the last half of research. The iterated version resulted in positive feedback.</p>

<p>After the research, we synthesized all the insights and findings. We got more deep insights of the touch points, motivations and content consumed of unintentional purchases. After the insights, we were able to have more design explorations to improve Smart Collection.<img src="images/p/smartcollection_08@2x.png" alt="Synthesizing after user study for insights" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0"><span class="caption" style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0;">Synthesizing after user study for insights</span></p>





<h3>Development and Future work</h3>
<p>Although Smart Collection shows positive in the research report, there are too much effort to implement all the features. So we picked features based on user needs, business impact and development effort to define the 1st version of Smart Collection.</p>
<p>After Smart Collection launched, we saw the positive results on the metrics. From the data, users are more willing to explore in Smart Collection. And from the research, we also learned there are also opportunities in other parts of user journey. So our next step is to extend Smart Collection to more touch points in Yahoo Shopping and leverage what we learn to go deeper and improve the existing design.</p>
