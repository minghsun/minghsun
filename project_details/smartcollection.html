<p class="project-notes">Design lead, conducted user research and synthesis for insights, 2018</p>

<p>Smart collection is a solution with aggreated styled products and triggers for motivating unintentional purchases.</p>



<h3>Project background and problems</h3>
<p>Most users visit e-commerce websites with intentions. And users always compare prices of different sites. Therefore, many e-commerce websites try to attract users with lower price. As there are more and more competitors cutting down the prices, the situation got tougher and tougher for <a href="https://tw.buy.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo Shopping</a>. Having promotions to attract users is effective. However, it’s a short-term solution and may hurt the platform in the long run. Since the problem is that most of the users are intentional and price-sensitive, our goal was to to motivate these users to gain unintentional purchases even when users visit with intentions.</p>



<h3>Defining users and journey</h3>
<p>We did user research for Yahoo shopping before this project and defined 4 types of users. So we started from examining the main journey of different types of users to see how we can drive the unintentional purchases. After discussion, we decided to focus on two types of users: product focus and Inspirational shopper. Because they both explore a lot in their main shopping journey. In the exploration phase, there are high chance to drive unintentional purchase.</p>

<p style="border-left: 6px solid #684DFD; padding-left: 22px">Product focus shoppers visit shopping website when they have a very clear intention. And they do researches before making buying decisions. They spent much time on exploring and understanding the product. When they decide what to buy, they usually compare the prices from different platform. 
<br>
<br>
Inspirational shoppers love to explore any kinds of product they may like. They usually visit the shopping website without clear intentions. And they are open to see new and different things and get inspired to explore more in shopping websites.

<h3>Define Scenario</h3>
<p>We looked into the potential scenarios of unintentional purchases. And we found the scenarios change when it comes to different categories of product. Therefore, we started to dig into main categories of our platform and found the following categories are more effective to drive the unintentional purchase: fashion, beauty & personal care, health & household, home & kitchen. From these categories, we found the common relevance is the visual look of products. </p>
<p>Our assumption is that, most users have their preference in styles. When the user have intentions of buying some thing, they focus on what they are looking for with their preference. If the user sees their preferred products with other related products of same style, there is a high chance to make the user start exploring more and lead to unintentional purchases eventually. Therefore, we identified styles is the main starting point of unintentional purchase<img src="images/p/smartcollection_02@2x.png" alt="Defining for scenarios" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0"><span class="caption" style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0;">Defining for scenarios</span></p>
<p>Also, we learned that many unintentional purchase scenarios happen when users are not buying something. Users may be just walking in a mall, reading magzines, or even just browsing on social media. All these scenarios happen because users inadvertently recieve information related to user’s preferences and needs. So we then brainstormed on what values we can provide based on all these online and offline experiences to come out with design solutions.

<h3>The Design Solution</h3>
<p>When searching for a product, users will see the entries of Smart Collection in the search result page. The entries show that Yahoo Shopping selected style products to recommend the users. If users like the style, they can visit Smart Collection to pick what they might like. And inside the Smart Collection, it’s a collection page with products in similar styles. The products stream is realted to search keywords. Besides of products, there are various inspirational modules with related product to motivate the users to explore products that are not what the users intended to buy. </p>
<p>As the below example, user intended to buy a bag so she entered search result page with the keyword “bag”. And we recommend the simple style bags collection from the user’s previous browing and buying preferences. By targeting preference, the user will visit the Smart Collection to see all the simple style bags. And among the bags the user likes, there are also other recommendations to make the user browse not just bags. The entire experience is like shopping in a fashion magzine. And we believe the magzine-like design can drive unintentional purchases.</p>

<h3>User research to validate our design </h3>
<p>To validate our hypothesis before development, we conducted user research to understand how user get motivated when they’re shopping online and to verify if our assumptions were right. We tested our design with high fidelity prototype to see if Smart Collection can motivate users to explore more on unintentional purchases. The result was great. The Participants love the inspirations we provided. They were all motivated by the inspirational modules and explore more products without notice. The only problem was the entry design in the search result page. We iterated the design and tested the iterated version in the last half of research. The iterated version resulted in positive feedback in the end. Besides of the feedback of the prototype, we also get more understood about how user get triggered when shopping. We sythesized all the insights and found out all the stimulus of driving unintentional purchases can be grouped in to 6 types: 1. Trending 2. personalized 3. celebrity, KOL or brand 4. inspirational 5. what’s new / new ideas 6. social.<img src="images/p/smartcollection_08@2x.png" alt="Synthesizing after user study for insights" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0"><span class="caption" style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0;">Synthesizing after user study for insights</span></p>



<h3>Development and Future work</h3>
<p>Although Smart Collection overally shows positive in the research report, there are too much effort to implement all the features. So we picked features based on user needs, business impact and development effort to define the 1st version of Smart Collection. </p>
<p>After Smart Collection launched, we saw the positive on the metrics. From the data, users are more willing to explore in Smart Collection and have a high potential to buy more products. And from the research, we also learned there are also opportunities in other parts of user journey. So our next step is to extend the Smart Collection to more touch points in Yahoo Shopping and leverage what we learn to improve the existing design.</p>
