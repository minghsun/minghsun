                    <p class="project-notes">Design for the entire app, marketing website, 2013</p>
                    <p>HitFM is one of the biggest broadcast companies in Taiwan. I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to design the official app for it. Most broadcast companies in Taiwan are facing the problem of losing audiences. An app is a very good way to reach more audiences. The companies could leverage from the traits of mobile apps. For example, the DJs could have more interactions with the audiences. Unlike the traditional broadcasts, the audiences now not only can listen but also benefit from the new technology. Therefore, having an app to extend their audiences is very important.</p>

                    <p>Unlike UFO Radio, the first broadcast app I designed at Olis, HitFM Radio focuses more on the music. The target group of HitFM are the music listeners. And the company holds concerts and music awards every year. So we decided to start with music-center design and came up with few features. Some of the features have huge impacts on this traditional industry. The chat room function made the users have more chances to interact with the DJs. The live streaming features turn broadcast into a semi TV show.</p>

                    <p>The design process was not going very well. There were some reasons that we had to start with visual proposals but not the fundamental design, like wireframes and flow of this app. This did lead to some problems. For examples, there are 7 tab icons for switching the features. All of them are lying at the bottom of the screen. But to make the button easier to be tapped, the screen could only contain 5 of them. So 2 of the icons are hidden out of the screen. Plus, horizontally scrolling the tab icons isn’t a common pattern that could confuse the users and lost the purpose of quick access, which is one of the reason tab icons were designed for. I tried to persuade the clients with other proposals. But they were fascinated and insist to keep the 7 tabs so I had to continue working on it. With the problems in front of me, I had to do something to eliminate them as possible as I could. One of the solutions was to design the icons with completely different kinds of shapes: circles, rectangles, trapezoids, stars. I used these shapes to make users easier to tell the differences between icons and can recognize them at quick glances. </p>

                    <p>The main structure of this app is so different from most of the iOS apps. So I tried to go along with iOS design pattern on rest parts of the design to avoid from violating the design principles. The overall experience is still pretty much like using an iOS app. And after shipping the app, the responses were pretty good. We’re glad to see users love this app.</p>
