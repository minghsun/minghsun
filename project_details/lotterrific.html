                    <p>Lotterrific was a two-weeks project for fun. During Lunar New Year, there would be a huge bonus prize provided from Taiwan Lottery. Among many lottery apps on App Store and Google Play, we couldn’t find a good lottery app that fits our basic needs, especially the most important feature for us: checking the lottery automatically and send notifications to inform ticket holders the results if they win the prizes. Therefore, we decided to make one on our own. From sketches to a working app, it took us only one and a half weeks. It was fun. And surprisingly, we got some Taiwan mainstream tech bloggers writing about this app. It was a small success for us.</p>

                    <p class="caption">defining the users and problems</p>

                    <p>When I started this project I took some time to confirm what kind of lottery app this would be. First, the user, There are many kinds of people who would buy lottery. But not all of them need an app to check the lottery. I listed all potential users and narrow down to two types of people:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People who buy the lottery regularly. From observations, we know that most of them buy the same numbers every time.</li>
                        <li>None regular player. They buy the lottery for some special reasons. For example, when the prize is very big.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The first type of people do need a tool to check the lottery automatically because they buy the lottery very often and checking lottery all the time is bothersome. And a notification to inform the winning result would be a great surprising gift for them when the delightful sound rings from their smartphone. The needs for the second type of people are quite different. They don’t necessarily need a tool to help them do the checking. Since they buy the lottery once in a while, they would like to know the result as soon as possible. Checking the lottery conveniently is the most important.</p>
                    <p>After, I started to look into all the lottery apps on the App Store and Google Play to see what kind of problems there are and what kind of things/features are missing. After the investigation, I summarized four points that I would be focus on: the design of the information, usability (easy and fast to use), automatically checking the lottery number, the relation between the app and the act of buying lottery. With these four points I put it forth and discussed with my PM, we came up with the architecture of this app and I started to work on the interface.</p>

                    <p class="caption">Early sketches and wireframes</p>

                    <p>I did some sketches on the paper to clear out my thoughts. Then I used <a href="https://popapp.in" target="_blank" onclick="gaOutLink('lottery_pop')">POP</a> to make a low-fidelity prototype and tested with some friends. After the flow and interface are confirmed, I handed them to engineers and started the visual design. While engineers work on the structure, I had more time refining the visual details of the app. To catch up the date of the special prized lottery, we had less than two weeks to make all these happen. It was crazy.</p>
