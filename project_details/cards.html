                    <h1 class="card-title">Loyalty Cards App Concept, 2014</h1>

                    <p>We were making a loyalty card app which users can collect all the loyalty card in without having too many cards in their wallets. This was a UI experiment. I tried to provide meaningful interactions for the users to understand the screen transition. In the end, this wasn't implemented. But I had a lot of fun exploring new ways of interaction. <a class="" href="http://share.framerjs.com/yd2ric2wgiaf/" target="_blank" onclick="gaOutLink('cards_prototype')">This is the prototype made with FramerJS you can play with.</a> </p>
